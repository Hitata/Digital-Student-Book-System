# Digit Recognition System.

A Program that can extract and understand numbers (0-9) from an photographed image.

## Usage

- Senior project at University

- Further research into more precise recognition algorithm (SVM, Deep NN)

- Digital Handbook System project.


## Structure

Program consist of 3 part.

1. Image Processing:

- Algorithm for Grayscale image, Binary image, Invert Image, Skew Image, Resizing Image
- Algorithm for Noise removal, Dilation, Erosion,

2. Feature extraction:

- Alogirithm for Image segmentation, Block segment, Character Segment, Thinning, 

3. Recognition Phase:

- Normalize Input for recognition.
- Kohonen Neural Network (Self Organize Mapping)
- Unsupervise learning algorithm. 

4. Reference

- AForge Framework. (aforgenet.com)
- OpenCV library. (opencv.org)
